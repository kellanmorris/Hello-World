 <center> If the purchasing a Negroe for a slave be an <i> infringement of devine and human laws, </i> <br>
  in God's name, why is such a trade permitted? A few words in act of parliament <br>
  prohibiting the importation or sale of Negroes in our colonies will destroy the <br>
  practive in future. --- And a few words more, declaring the offspring of Negroes <br>
  already imported to be free, will prevent slavery extending to the next generation.

   <center> 
     If purchasing a Slave is an <i> "infriengement of devine and human laws" </i> <br>
   then WHY is it being allowed? The act of importing or selling slaves in our colony is prohibited, <br>
   and will hurt our future if we continue. <br>
   <br>
   .... Declaring the offspring of slaves to already be imported to be free, <br>
will further prevent slavery continuing in the future generations.
