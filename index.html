 <center> If the purchasing a Negroe for a slave be an <i> infringement of devine and human laws, </i> <br>
  in God's name, why is such a trade permitted? A few words in act of parliament <br>
  prohibiting the importation or sale of Negroes in our colonies will destroy the <br>
  practive in future. --- And a few words more, declaring the offspring of Negroes <br>
  already imported to be free, will prevent slavery extending to the next generation.
